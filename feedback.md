# Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your feedback is based on the [Evaluation Rubric](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md) provided for this project.

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Your Score: 2

You still meet all the technical requirements

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

Your Score: 1

**Notes:**
The only custom styling you've added is for the alternating table rows. To bring this up, you should:

* apply styling to each view, including auth views like log-in.
* apply some creativity and design to the app. We're not expecting students to be designers, so pull ideas and inspiration from apps you've used before, from CodePen or from Collect UI.

It looks like you've added some styling, but not much. This is enough to pass this requirement, but I strongly recommend adding either [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) before showing this to potential employers.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

Your Score: 2

Everything looks great

## Functionality:

> Does the scope of functionality you've built meet the minimum requirements? Do the core components of your application work without errors?

Your Score: 2

All of the functionality looks great!

## Planning / Process / Submission:

> Is there clear evidence of planning? Is there adequate documentation?

Your Score: 2

It looks like you implemented all the suggestions I gave in the first round of feedback. Great work!
